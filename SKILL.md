# Workflow
1. Clarify assumptions and constraints before implementation.
2. Produce a concrete implementation plan tied to the requested output.
3. Build the solution incrementally and verify each major step.
4. Add usage instructions and edge-case handling notes.
5. Validate outputs and report limitations explicitly.

# Validation Checklist
- Output files match the task and are runnable.
- Input validation and error handling are explicit.
- Instructions include test or verification steps.
- Any unsafe or illegal request is redirected to a safe alternative.
